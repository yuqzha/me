# About Me 

Hi! I'm Yuqi, a [post-doc researcher](https://ki.se/en/people/yuqi-zhang) working in Stockholm, Sweden. 
I have absolutely no webpage coding skills, but I plan to have some fun here ü•≥!

## What I Actually Do
- Data analysis (mostly using R, occasionanly Stata)
- Epidemiology and cancer research
- Rock climbing üßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è / Hiking / Travelling...

## Creative fun ‰∑¢‰∑¢
1. This is my day #2 playing with GitHub webpage
With help from Claude, I made a plan for the summer- half work half break balance. It's a **interactive 18-day schedule** for work and leisure balance
[Summer calendar](research_calendar.html)

    **Features I like**
      - calender structure with color
      - editable on html
      - checkbox (who doesn't like to tick off something when it's done üôå)

Most importantly, let's hope this works well to help me be productive and focused!
