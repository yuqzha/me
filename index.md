# About Me 

Hi! I'm Yuqi, a [post-doc researcher](https://ki.se/en/people/yuqi-zhang) working in Stockholm, Sweden. 
I have absolutely no webpage coding skills, but I plan to have some fun here 🥳!

## What I Actually Do
- Data analysis (mostly using R, occasionanly Stata)
- Epidemiology and cancer research
- Rock climbing 🧗‍♀️ / Hiking / Travelling...

## Creative fun ䷢䷢
1. This is my day #2 playing with GitHub webpage
With help from Claude, I made a plan for the summer- half work half break balance.
It's a **interactive 18-day schedule** for work and leisure balance
[Summer calendar](research_calendar.html)

    **Features I like**
      - calender structure with color
      - editable on html (localStorage functionality)
      - checkbox (who doesn't like to tick off something when it's done 🙌)

Most importantly, let's hope this works well to help me be productive and focused!

2. **Problem**:Although the above calendar works that changes can be seen using the same browser on the condition that the browser data are not cleared, I would like to be able to have an updated file that I can keep in the end.
**Solution**: export option added to the html so it can be saved and updated when needed:  [Summer calender export option added](research_calendar_v2.html)

This is becoming cool!
